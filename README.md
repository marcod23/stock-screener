# stock-screener

Some old Python code that scrapes a website with stock information. Could definitely use some updating and commenting.

Outputs a well-organized list of public companies (from a list of about 3000 US stock tickers) that pass a specific screening based on revenue growth, earnings growth, free cash flow growth, etc. Just some good solid stocks to invest in! 

Not financial advice of course.
