# stock-screener

Some old Python code that scrapes a website with stock information. Could definitely use some commenting and cleaning up. I planned on running this every year or two and just dealing with the lack of robustness then :)

Outputs a well-organized list of public companies (from a list of 3000 US stock tickers) that pass a specific screening based on revenue growth, earnings growth, free cash flow growth, etc. I also added a quick discounted cash flow model to roughly estimate fair value. Just some good solid stocks to invest in! 

Not financial advice of course.
